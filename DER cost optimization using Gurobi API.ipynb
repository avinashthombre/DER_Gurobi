    "# Distributed Energy Resources Cost Optimization using Gurobi Python API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note \n",
    "The data used below is just for the purpose of implementing the Gurobi optimizer. This Gurobi optimizer solution is of low to medium difficulty. The intention of this Jupyter notebook is to demonstrate the use of Python and Gurobi API for implementing optimization solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This work takes into account the consumers individual objectives considering multiple criteria. It is challenging for consumers to compare electricity purchases across difference metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model addresses optimal allocation and pricing of generation by DER. As this is a question of short-term (operational) dispatch rather than long-term planning, investment decisions and corresponding costs are not part of the modeling framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "It selects an optimal set of energy sources to satisfy anticipated power demand over a 24-hour time horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is of intermediate difficulty and implemented using Python and the Gurobi Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Energy sources are grouped into three distinct types - grid, PV, battery, with different characteristics for each type (power output, cost per unit hour, startup cost, etc.). A source can be on or off, with a startup cost associated with transitioning from off to on, and power output that can fall anywhere between a specified minimum and maximum value when the unit is on. A 24-hour time horizon is divided into 5 discrete time periods, each with an expected total power demand. The model decides which units to turn on, and when, in order to satisfy demand for each time period. The model also captures a reserve requirement, where the selected sources must be capable of increasing their output, while still respecting their maximum output, in order to cope with the situation where actual demand exceeds predicted demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anticipated demand is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Time Period | Demand (megawatts) |\n",

    "| 3 pm to 6 pm | 40000 |\n",
    "| 6 pm to 12 pm | 27000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Sources are grouped into three types PV, battery and grid, with the following minimum and maximum output for each type (when they are on):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Number available | Minimum output (MW) | Maximum output (MW) |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 0 | 12 |  850 | 2000 |\n",
    "| 1 | 10 | 1250 | 1750 |\n",
    "| 2 | 5 | 1500 | 4000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "There are costs associated with using a sources: a cost per hour when the source is on (and generating its minimum output), a cost per kW hour in dollars above its minimum:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type | Cost per hour (when on) | Cost per MWh above minimum | Startup cost |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",

    "| 2 | $\\$3000$ | $\\$3.00$ | $\\$500$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Sources must meet predicted demand, but they must also have sufficient reserve capacity to be able to cope with the situation where actual demand exceeds predicted demand. For this model, the set of selected sources must be able to produce as much as 115% of predicted demand.\n",

    "Thus, using Gurobi Python API and Python, we can implement the cost optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the word document shared in the email, we can formulate various models, write their constraints, sets, define input data and use the Gurobi optimizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gurobi Optimizer can be used for following major new features; \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Non-Convex Quadratic Optimization: With the addition of a new bilinear solver, the Gurobi Optimizer now supports non-convex quadratic optimization. This groundbreaking new capability allows users to solve problems with non-convex quadratic constraints and objectives – enabling them to find globally optimal solutions to classic bilinear pooling and blending problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Piecewise-Linear (PWL) Constraints: Users can now add PWL constraints directly as a modeling construct instead of having to represent them as a combination of linear and SOS constraints – thereby greatly simplifying their use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Function Constraints with Automatic PWL Translation: With Gurobi 9.0, users can add nine basic, nonlinear, univariate function constraints – including polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions – and the Gurobi Optimizer will perform an automatic piecewise-linear approximation of these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python Matrix API: The Gurobi Optimizer’s Python interface has been extended to support matrix-oriented modeling using NumPy or SciPy matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- MIP Scenario Analysis: This new feature allows users to construct multiple scenarios and run them simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "- New Solution Improvement Heuristic: Gurobi 9.0 provides a new, more effective heuristic for focusing on improving MIP solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intermediate Solution Files: Users are now able to write solutions found during the MIP solution process to files as soon as they are discovered."
